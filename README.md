# CatSSR

A simple Vue app using SSR on a NodeJS server.

While the static part of the app is rendered on the server, the cat images are rendered by the client.
This help to fasten the loading time of the app, and still have dynamic content.

I used the CatApi (https://thecatapi.com/) to generate the cat images.

###
You can run the app by 

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
